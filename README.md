# BST260Project

Steps to view our project:

Check out our website: https://sites.google.com/view/mooddip-bst260-project/overview
Check out our screenscast: https://www.dropbox.com/s/7zb748z7leromab/zoom_0.mp4?dl=0
Look at our code by following the steps below:

1. Download all the files you'll need here and unzip the folder: https://www.dropbox.com/s/phwmrq2qjmzunk7/260master.zip?dl=0
2. Download RM.Rmd and/or .hmtl or PDF version of our R markdown within this repository.
3. Change the directory in the RM file to where you have our project folder saved on your computer. You need to do this in two places: At the top of the file and where the first image in the file is embedded.

NOTE:

To run our shiny app, it is advisable to run it via the app.R file in our repository, rather than the R markdown. 
We have the inferred sleep subsection in our R markdown set to eval=FALSE due to high computational power necessary to run it. Delete eval=FALSE in all the corresponding code chunks if you want to run that section.
